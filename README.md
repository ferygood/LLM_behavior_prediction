# Cross-platform user behavior prediction system

Develop a system that utilize LLM to predict user behavior from multiple platform. The system can clean and analyze real-time data, including data collection, data cleaning, model traning, deploying and monitoring.

## Data Collection and Pre-process

Collect user behavior data from multiple sources (such as website visit records, shopping behavior, social media interactions, etc.).
Use tools such as Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing, use Pandas and NumPy for data transformation and feature engineering.

## Model development

Use Python and TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop a large language model (such as BERT or GPT) to predict user behavior.
Train the model using existing labeled data and use cross-validation to tune model parameters.
Evaluate model performance using common evaluation metrics (such as precision, recall, F1 score) to evaluate model effectiveness.

## System architecture and deployment

Design system architecture, use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and manage model services.
Implement the MLops process and use tools such as MLflow or Kubeflow to manage model deployment, monitoring, and updates.
Establish a monitoring system and use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system performance and model effects.
Results display and document writing

## Develop a simple web application to display prediction results and system performance. 
Use Flask or Django to build the application front-end.
Write detailed project documents, including project background, technical details, implementation steps and result analysis.

## Technology
Pandas, NumPy, Apache kafka, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Kubeflow, Prometheus, Grafana, Flask, Django
